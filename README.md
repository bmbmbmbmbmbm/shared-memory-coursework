# Shared-Memory-Coursework
Code for multi-threaded matrix relaxation using pthread in C.

## Aims of the Coursework

Attempt to implement a really simple sequential problem using threads, record the times taken using different thread counts and make observations about the data.

The solution is ran on a partition provided by Azure, which allowed up to 44 threads to run in parallel.
